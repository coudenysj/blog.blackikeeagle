# Ike Devolder aka BlackIkeEagle

Ike is an 'old' (senior) webdeveloper at [Studio Emma](http://www.studioemma.com/).

Most of his professional time is spent programming PHP. But he is also busy doing git workflow and creating scripts to make our life as developers easier.
Providing a vagrant box provisioned with puppet to make sure we can develop in an environment practically the same as production.

In his free time the biggest interest is Metal music and [Archlinux](https://www.archlinux.org/). Being a [Trusted User](https://www.archlinux.org/trustedusers/#idevolder) at Archlinux means following up on new software is part of the 'free' time :).
