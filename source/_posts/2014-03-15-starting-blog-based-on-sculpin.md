In the past i would have said, I have nothing interesting to tell people worthy of putting in a blog.
Now I changed my mind and I kinda starting a blog to keep myself from forgetting how I got something done :)

This blog is based on [sculpin](https://sculpin.io) so everything is written in [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

The choice for a static site generator is fairly simple, blogs are in general not really dynamic content and so it will be FAST :).
